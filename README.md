## Real Books

**Application Uses...**

```
  Redux
```

**What does Real Books do?**

Provides a full list of books available to view. Each item in the list can be clicked to view more details about that book.

**How does it do this?**

The book list found on the website is generated by pulling the book data from the application state made posssible by redux. This piece of state is then mapped to display the title of each book on the list. 

When an item is clicked, then an action is fired that pulls the selected book "off the shelf" of the redux store so that more details about it can be displayed.
